        <H3>What is Spiritual Direction?</H3>
        <p>Spiritual Direction is an ancient practice of sacred conversation between a spiritual seeker looking to deepen their spiritual practice and a trained spiritual guide.  It is a listening practice where you and the director listen together for the fingerprints of God in the narrative of your life.  You come to the session with a topic that you would like to explore and the director listens deeply, searching for the presence of the Spirit.  The director assists in uncovering and discovering the prompts of God in the ordinary and extraordinary moments of life.  The director asks questions to guide you towards the movements of God so that your spiritual story unfolds before you.  Sessions are a safe place to explore the depth of emotional experience, the wisdom of faith, and contemplative practices. </p>

        <h3>What is Enneagram Coaching?</h3>
        <p>The Enneagram is a system for understanding the human condition.  It explains nine masks, or archetypes, that we put on to cope with the situations we find ourselves in.  Over time we eventually pick one of these types as our primary way of being in the world, and while it served us at some point, it becomes a barrier to growth as it becomes a more rigid pattern.  Each of the nine types describes motivations, virtues, vices, and ideals that you live by.  By learning the Enneagram you gain a deeper understanding of why you see and engage with the world the way that you do.  An Enneagram Coach helps you to identify your type pattern, work with that pattern, and eventually break free of the pattern.  An Enneagram Coach also helps you to understand the other eight types increasing your capacity to work well within your relationships at home and at work. </p>
